# Introduction 
This is Pytorch and Ml-Agents based front end for learning reinforcement learning based models for visual navigation.

# Getting Started

## To run the singularity container
1. Ask Armando for latest version number of container, e.g. 0.0.1
* Note: Do it on a partiton that has at least 10GB space as the next step will create navsim_0.0.1.sif file of ~10GB.
2. singularity pull docker://ghcr.io/armando-fandango/navsim:0.0.1'
3. singularity shell --nv navsim_0.0.1.sif'

## To run NeuralSLAM on Habitat

# Contribute

Only Armando is building and developing in this repo for now. Once we open development for others, we shall add instructions here.
